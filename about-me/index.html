<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Oliver Weissbarth and live in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<h1 id=my-start-in-3d-graphics>My start in 3D-Graphics</h1>
<p>I was first introduced to 3D-graphics around 2009 when my dad found a copy of movie3D by AIST on a pc magazine CD. I played around with it a little and joined a 3D group on a german social networking site. Another member posted a 3D steam locomotive. I was totally amazed and wanted to create something similar.</p>
<p>He suggested trying out Blender, an open source 3D package with an awesome community. And I did. I opened Blender for the first time and closed it almost immediately. It was hard, and way different from movie3D.</p>
<p>It took me a few month to “recover” and try again.
I remember very distinctly watching a tutorial on creating trees when it clicked. I suddenly understood how blender worked. But still I had a long way to go.</p>
<p>Then Blender 2.5 happened: a full user interface redesign. And I started from scratch again. Luckily this time everything was a lot easier. 3D-graphics became my hobby.</p>
<p>In 2012 I led a group of students through my own 3D-graphics project during the annual project week at my highschool. It was quite successful and I was invited again next year when I had already left school. I started teaching Blender and 3D-graphics to middle/high-school students at multiple schools and for other clients as freelancer.</p>
<p>With time I got more and more into the technical side of things and decided to study computer science at Technische Universität Berlin. My main focus was on the intersection of computer graphics, computer vision and machine learning.</p>
<h1 id=present>Present</h1>
<p>I currently working as a C++ software engineer in medical technologies sector.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to <a href=https://oweissbarth.github.io/software/bookgen/>create tools for 3D artists</a>. I also maintain a few packages for the <a target=_blank href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=oweissbarth">Arch User Repository</a>.</p>
<p>From time to time I also dabble in Blender. My artwork can be found on <a target=_blank href=https://www.artstation.com/oweissbarth>Artstation</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally enjoy playing with different technologies so I have various smaller projects and experiments on <a target=_blank href=https://www.github.com/oweissbarth>Github</a>.</p>
<h1 id=get-in-touch>Get in touch</h1>
<p>If you want to get in touch send me an email or find me on <a target=_blank href=https://www.twitter.com/oweissbarth>twitter</a>.</p>
